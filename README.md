### Clone Webpage with React.js and API Integration.

Objective: 
In this assignment, you will be tasked with cloning a webpage and integrating a public API to fetch random user details. You'll use React.js to create a responsive and interactive table design as shown in the reference image. Additionally, you'll implement a search functionality to allow users to search for users by a specific string in the Name, Username, or Email columns.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
